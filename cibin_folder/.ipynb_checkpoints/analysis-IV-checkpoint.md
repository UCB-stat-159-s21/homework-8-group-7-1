#### Would you recommend this treatment to a friend or relative?
After reading through the saftey information and the information about the subjects from the press release, we would be hesitant to recommend this treatment to friends and family. REGEN-COV has only been approved for emergency use, not general use. Also, while Phase III trial results have been released, there are still multiple other trials that are still in progress such as clinical trials in multiple settings for COVID-19. These settings include prevention of COVID-19 in household contacts of infected individuals, with hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, and the open-label RECOVERTY trial of hospitalized patients in the UK. However, these trials have shown promising success and have had included a large amount of participants at 25,000 people so far as of April 2021. 

Currently these Phase III trial results are from people who aged between 12-92 years old but 38% of them were aged 50 years old and the median age of the study was 44 years old. Consequently, we would be hesitant to recommend the treatment to children aged 12-15 years old since there weren't that many participants of that age range who have participated so far.

As for individuals who are pregnant, we would recommend them to get the COVID-19 vaccine rather than this RENEG-COV antibody cocktail because although there are limited clinical experience with both the cocktail and the vaccine, the CDC and many experts would recommend getting vaccinated. 

#### Is there something else you would want to know first?

Something else that we would want to know first would be more about the clinical worsening after the REGEN-COV administration because the researchers do not know if this worsening is from the treatment itself or from the progression of COVID-19. 

As stated before, many of the clinical trial subjects were adults who were above 21 years old. We would therefore want to know more about the effects on individuals who are children between the ages of 12-15 years old similar to how the FDA tested children separately from older adults for the vaccine.
