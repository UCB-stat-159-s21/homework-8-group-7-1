# cibin-template

## TO DO:
Update this README.md file with information about your package implementation in a similar way to how it is done in [this example](https://github.com/fperez/mytoy). 

This repository contains a cibin Python package with a few analysis and demo files.

It has a single source directory (cibin_folder) with an __init__.py file and one "implementation" file (cibin.py) as well as a few tests in cibin_folder/tests.

In addition to this README.md it includes some basic infrastructure: LICENSE, requirements.txt, setup.py and .gitignore files.
