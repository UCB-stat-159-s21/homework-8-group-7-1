Sana Khader, Gregory King, and Jacqueline Yu completed the assignment at times with pair programming over Zoom and also looking through each PR to check for any issues in the code. Gregory translated the R code for the `pval_two`, `check_compatible`, and `tau_lower_N11_twoside` functions. He also completed Analysis IV for the written portion. Jacqueline translated the R code for the `comb`, `tau_twoside_less_treated`, and `tau_twoside` functions. She also worked on Analysis II - III. Gregory and Jacqueline worked together on Analysis I. Sana mainly worked on the translation of the R code for the `nchoosem` and `tau_twoside_lower` functions and unit tests for all the translated R code functions for correctness and correct input implentation. The work was split evenly and all partners contributed.
